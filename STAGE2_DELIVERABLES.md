## Key Features Delivered

### Enterprise-Grade Workflow Engine
The platform now supports complex, multi-step coordination workflows with comprehensive state management, error handling, and audit trails. Organizations can define sophisticated business processes that span multiple agents and external systems.

### Real-Time Monitoring and Analytics
Comprehensive monitoring capabilities provide deep insights into agent performance, coordination success rates, and system health. Automated alerting ensures proactive management of platform operations.

### Seamless External Integrations
Webhook-based event notifications and API connectors enable seamless integration with existing business tools and processes. The platform can now participate in broader organizational workflows.

### Dynamic Service Discovery
Agents can dynamically register their capabilities and discover other agents, enabling more flexible and resilient coordination patterns. This supports cloud-native deployment scenarios where agents may scale up and down dynamically.

### Production-Ready Performance
Caching and asynchronous processing capabilities ensure the platform can handle enterprise-scale workloads while maintaining responsive performance. The architecture supports horizontal scaling and high availability deployments.

## Testing Status

| Component | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | Status |
|-----------|------------|------------------|---------|
| Workflows | ✅ | ⚠️ | Functional, tests need refinement |
| Monitoring | ✅ | ⚠️ | Functional, Redis dependency |
| Webhooks | ✅ | ⚠️ | Functional, external service mocking |
| Discovery | ✅ | ⚠️ | Functional, database relationship issues |
| Performance | ✅ | ✅ | Complete and passing |

## Deployment Readiness

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with updated schema migrations
- **Cache**: Redis for caching and metrics storage  
- **Queue**: Redis for Celery task queue
- **Worker**: Celery worker processes for background tasks

### Configuration Updates
- Environment variables for Redis connections
- Celery broker and backend configuration
- Monitoring and alerting thresholds
- Webhook security settings

### Security Considerations

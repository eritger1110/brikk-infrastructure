# Brikk Platform - Deployment Guide

**Author:** Manus AI  
**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the Brikk Agent Coordination Platform, ensure that your environment meets the following requirements. The platform requires a modern containerized infrastructure with support for persistent storage, networking, and service orchestration.

**System Requirements:**
- Docker Engine 20.10 or later with Docker Compose support
- PostgreSQL 13 or later for primary data storage
- Redis 7.0 or later for caching and rate limiting
- Node.js 18 or later for frontend build processes
- Python 3.9 or later for backend services
- Minimum 4GB RAM and 2 CPU cores for development environments
- Minimum 8GB RAM and 4 CPU cores for production environments

**Network Requirements:**
- HTTPS/TLS termination capability for secure communications
- Load balancer support for high availability deployments
- Firewall configuration allowing HTTP/HTTPS traffic on standard ports
- Internal network connectivity between application components

## Environment Configuration

The Brikk platform uses environment variables for configuration management, enabling secure and flexible deployment across different environments. Create environment-specific configuration files that contain the necessary parameters for your deployment.

**Required Environment Variables:**

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database_name
DATABASE_POOL_SIZE=20
DATABASE_MAX_OVERFLOW=30

# Redis Configuration
REDIS_URL=redis://host:port/database_number
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password

# Security Configuration
SECRET_KEY=your_application_secret_key
FERNET_KEY=your_fernet_encryption_key
HMAC_SECRET_KEY=your_hmac_signing_key

# Application Configuration
FLASK_ENV=production
FLASK_DEBUG=false
BRIKK_ALLOW_UUID4=true

# Rate Limiting Configuration
RATE_LIMIT_DEFAULT=100
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=3600

# Logging Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
LOG_FORMAT=json
```

Generate secure random keys for production deployments using cryptographically secure random number generators. The Fernet key must be exactly 32 bytes encoded in base64 format. HMAC secret keys should be at least 32 bytes of random data.

## Database Setup

Initialize the PostgreSQL database with the required schema and initial data. The platform uses Alembic for database migrations, providing version control for schema changes and enabling consistent deployments across environments.

**Database Initialization Steps:**

1. Create a dedicated database and user for the Brikk platform with appropriate permissions
2. Install the required Python dependencies including SQLAlchemy and Alembic
3. Run database migrations to create the initial schema
4. Create initial administrative users and organizations as needed
5. Configure database connection pooling and performance parameters

Execute the following commands to initialize the database:

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize database schema
flask db upgrade

# Create initial administrative data
python scripts/create_admin_user.py
```

Ensure that database backup and recovery procedures are established before deploying to production. Configure automated backups with appropriate retention policies and test restore procedures to verify backup integrity.

## Redis Configuration

Configure Redis for optimal performance in the coordination platform environment. Redis serves multiple purposes including rate limiting, session management, and caching of frequently accessed data.

**Redis Configuration Parameters:**

```redis
# Memory management
maxmemory 2gb
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru

# Persistence configuration
save 900 1
save 300 10
save 60 10000

# Security configuration
requirepass your_redis_password
bind 127.0.0.1

# Performance tuning
tcp-keepalive 300
timeout 0
```

Configure Redis persistence based on your durability requirements. For production environments, enable both RDB snapshots and AOF logging to ensure data durability. Monitor Redis memory usage and configure appropriate eviction policies to prevent out-of-memory conditions.

## Backend Deployment

Deploy the Flask-based backend API using a production-ready WSGI server such as Gunicorn or uWSGI. Configure the server with appropriate worker processes and threading parameters based on your expected load patterns.

**Gunicorn Configuration Example:**

```python
# gunicorn.conf.py
bind = "0.0.0.0:8000"
workers = 4
worker_class = "sync"
worker_connections = 1000
max_requests = 1000
max_requests_jitter = 100
timeout = 30
keepalive = 2
preload_app = True
```

Create a systemd service file for automatic startup and process management:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Brikk Coordination API
After=network.target postgresql.service redis.service

[Service]
Type=notify
User=brikk
Group=brikk
WorkingDirectory=/opt/brikk
ExecStart=/opt/brikk/venv/bin/gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py app:app
ExecReload=/bin/kill -s HUP $MAINPID
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Configure log rotation and monitoring for the backend services. Implement health check endpoints that can be used by load balancers and monitoring systems to verify service availability.

## Frontend Deployment

Build and deploy the React-based frontend application using a production-optimized build process. The frontend should be served through a web server with appropriate caching headers and compression enabled.

**Frontend Build Process:**

```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies
cd brikk-ui
npm install

# Build production assets
npm run build

# Deploy built assets to web server
cp -r dist/* /var/www/brikk-ui/
```

**Nginx Configuration Example:**

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    
    ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private-key.pem;
    
    root /var/www/brikk-ui;
    index index.html;
    
    # Enable gzip compression
    gzip on;
    gzip_types text/css application/javascript application/json;
    
    # Cache static assets
    location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg)$ {
        expires 1y;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
    }
    
    # API proxy configuration
    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://backend-servers;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
    
    # Single page application routing
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

Configure appropriate security headers including Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

## Docker Deployment

For containerized deployments, use the provided Docker configuration files to build and deploy the platform components. Docker Compose provides orchestration for multi-container deployments with proper networking and dependency management.

**Docker Compose Configuration:**

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: brikk
      POSTGRES_USER: brikk_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secure_password
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    command: redis-server --requirepass secure_redis_password
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"

  backend:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.backend
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://brikk_user:secure_password@postgres:5432/brikk
      REDIS_URL: redis://:secure_redis_password@redis:6379/0
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - redis
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"

  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./brikk-ui
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    depends_on:
      - backend

volumes:
  postgres_data:
  redis_data:
```

Build and deploy the containers using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Build container images
docker-compose build

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# View service logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

## Load Balancing and High Availability

For production deployments requiring high availability, configure load balancing across multiple backend instances. Use health check endpoints to ensure that traffic is only routed to healthy instances.

**HAProxy Configuration Example:**

```haproxy
global
    daemon
    log stdout local0

defaults
    mode http
    timeout connect 5000ms
    timeout client 50000ms
    timeout server 50000ms

frontend brikk_frontend
    bind *:80
    bind *:443 ssl crt /path/to/certificate.pem
    redirect scheme https if !{ ssl_fc }
    default_backend brikk_backend

backend brikk_backend
    balance roundrobin
    option httpchk GET /health
    server backend1 10.0.1.10:8000 check
    server backend2 10.0.1.11:8000 check
    server backend3 10.0.1.12:8000 check
```

Configure session affinity if required by your application architecture, though the Brikk platform is designed to be stateless and should not require sticky sessions.

## Monitoring and Logging

Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to ensure operational visibility and enable rapid incident response. Configure log aggregation and metrics collection to support both real-time monitoring and historical analysis.

**Monitoring Components:**
- Application performance monitoring with response time and error rate tracking
- Infrastructure monitoring including CPU, memory, and disk utilization
- Database performance monitoring with query analysis and connection pool metrics
- Redis monitoring including memory usage and command statistics
- Security event monitoring with authentication failure and rate limiting alerts

Configure centralized logging using tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or similar solutions. Ensure that logs include sufficient context for troubleshooting while avoiding the inclusion of sensitive information.

## Security Considerations

Implement comprehensive security measures throughout the deployment process. Security should be considered at every layer from network configuration to application-level controls.

**Security Checklist:**
- Enable TLS/SSL for all external communications with strong cipher suites
- Configure firewall rules to restrict access to internal services
- Implement regular security updates for all system components
- Use strong, unique passwords for all service accounts
- Enable audit logging for all administrative actions
- Configure intrusion detection and prevention systems
- Implement regular security assessments and penetration testing

Ensure that all sensitive configuration parameters are stored securely and not included in version control systems. Use secrets management solutions for production deployments.

## Backup and Recovery

Establish comprehensive backup and recovery procedures to protect against data loss and enable rapid recovery from system failures. Test backup and recovery procedures regularly to ensure they function correctly when needed.

**Backup Strategy:**
- Daily automated database backups with point-in-time recovery capability
- Configuration file backups including environment variables and certificates
- Application code backups through version control systems
- Regular testing of backup restoration procedures
- Offsite backup storage for disaster recovery scenarios

Document recovery procedures and ensure that operations staff are trained on recovery processes. Establish recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) based on business requirements.

## Performance Tuning

Optimize system performance based on observed usage patterns and load characteristics. Monitor key performance indicators and adjust configuration parameters to maintain optimal performance.

**Performance Optimization Areas:**
- Database query optimization and indexing strategies
- Connection pool sizing for database and Redis connections
- Web server worker process and thread configuration
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Network configuration and bandwidth optimization

Implement performance testing procedures to validate system behavior under load and identify potential bottlenecks before they impact production operations.

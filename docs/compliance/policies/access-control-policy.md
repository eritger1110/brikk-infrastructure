# Access Control Policy

## 1. Introduction

This policy defines the requirements for controlling access to Brikk's information systems and data. The purpose of this policy is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data and to ensure that access is granted on a need-to-know basis, consistent with the principle of least privilege.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all Brikk employees, contractors, and other personnel who have access to Brikk's information systems and data. It covers all company-owned and managed systems, including servers, applications, databases, and network devices.

## 3. Policy Statements

### 3.1. Principle of Least Privilege

All users will be granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job responsibilities. Access rights will be reviewed regularly to ensure they remain appropriate.

### 3.2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Access to systems and data will be based on predefined roles. Each role will have a set of permissions that are aligned with the responsibilities of that role. This ensures that access is granted in a consistent and manageable way.

### 3.3. User Access Reviews

User access rights will be reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that they are still required and appropriate. The results of these reviews will be documented in the [Access Review Log](../evidence-templates/access-review-log.csv).

### 3.4. Authentication

All users must authenticate to Brikk systems using a unique user ID and a strong password. Where technically feasible, multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be enabled for all systems that store or process sensitive data.

### 3.5. Access Termination

Access for terminated employees will be revoked immediately upon termination. Access will also be revoked when a user's job responsibilities no longer require it.

### 3.6. Physical Access

Access to physical locations where sensitive data is stored, such as data centers and server rooms, will be restricted to authorized personnel only. All physical access will be logged and monitored.

## 1. Introduction

This policy outlines the requirements for managing third-party vendors that provide services or products to Brikk. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all vendors meet Brikk's security and compliance standards, in order to protect our data and our customers.

## 3. Policy Statements

### 3.1. Vendor Risk Assessment

All potential vendors must undergo a risk assessment before being onboarded. The risk assessment will evaluate the vendor's security posture, compliance with relevant regulations, and overall risk to Brikk. The results of the risk assessment will be used to determine whether to approve the vendor and to identify any additional security controls that may be required.

### 3.2. Contractual Requirements

All vendor contracts must include a security addendum that outlines the vendor's security and compliance obligations. The security addendum must include provisions for:

-   Data confidentiality
-   Security incident notification
-   Right to audit
-   Compliance with applicable laws and regulations

### 3.3. Ongoing Monitoring

All vendors will be subject to ongoing monitoring to ensure that they continue to meet Brikk's security and compliance standards. The monitoring process will include periodic risk assessments, reviews of security documentation, and performance monitoring.

### 3.4. Vendor Termination

When a vendor relationship is terminated, all access to Brikk's systems and data will be immediately revoked. All Brikk data held by the vendor will be securely returned or destroyed.

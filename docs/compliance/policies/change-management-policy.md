## 1. Introduction

This policy establishes the requirements for managing changes to Brikk's production systems and infrastructure. The goal of this policy is to ensure that all changes are properly planned, tested, and approved before being implemented, in order to minimize the risk of service disruptions, security vulnerabilities, and other negative impacts.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all changes to production systems, including but not limited to:

- Software deployments and updates
- Infrastructure changes (e.g., servers, networks, databases)
- Configuration changes
- Third-party service integrations

## 3. Policy Statements

### 3.1. Change Request Process

All changes to production systems must be initiated through a formal change request. The change request must include a detailed description of the change, the reason for the change, the potential impact of the change, and a rollback plan.

### 3.2. Testing and Validation

All changes must be thoroughly tested in a non-production environment before being deployed to production. The testing process should include functional testing, security testing, and performance testing, as appropriate.

### 3.3. Approval

All changes must be approved by the appropriate stakeholders before being deployed to production. The level of approval required will depend on the risk and impact of the change. High-risk changes will require approval from senior management.

### 3.4. Change Log

All changes to production systems will be documented in the [Change Log](../evidence-templates/change-log.csv). The change log will include a record of all change requests, approvals, and implementation details.

### 3.5. Emergency Changes

In the event of an emergency that requires an immediate change to a production system, the change may be implemented without following the full change management process. However, all emergency changes must be documented and reviewed after the fact.

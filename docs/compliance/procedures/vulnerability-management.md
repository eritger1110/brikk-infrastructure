# Vulnerability Management Procedure

## 1. Introduction

This document describes the process for identifying, assessing, remediating, and tracking security vulnerabilities at Brikk. This procedure is critical for maintaining a strong security posture and protecting against emerging threats.

## 2. Vulnerability Identification

Brikk employs a multi-layered approach to vulnerability identification:

*   **Automated Scanning**: Our CI/CD pipeline integrates several security tools to continuously scan for vulnerabilities:
    *   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Semgrep is used to analyze our source code for security flaws.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**: OWASP Dependency Check scans our third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Secret Detection**: Gitleaks scans our codebase for accidentally committed secrets.
*   **External Reporting**: We encourage responsible disclosure from external security researchers, as detailed in our root `SECURITY.md`.
*   **Internal Discovery**: Employees are required to report any security weaknesses they discover.

Details on our automated scanning tools are documented in the [Security CI Documentation](../../SECURITY_CI.md).

## 3. Assessment and Prioritization

Once a vulnerability is identified, it is triaged and prioritized by the Security Team based on the [Security Issue Intake and Triage](./security-issue-intake-and-triage.md) procedure. The severity of a vulnerability is determined by its potential impact and the likelihood of exploitation.

## 4. Remediation

Remediation timelines are based on the assigned severity level:

| Severity | Remediation SLA |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Critical** | < 24 hours |
| **High** | < 7 days |
| **Medium** | < 30 days |
| **Low** | < 90 days |

Vulnerabilities are tracked in our internal issue tracking system, and remediation progress is monitored by the Security Team.

## 5. Verification

After a vulnerability has been remediated, the Security Team will verify that the fix is effective and has been correctly implemented. This may involve re-running security scans, conducting penetration tests, or performing manual code reviews.

## 6. Reporting and Metrics

The Security Team provides monthly reports to management on the state of vulnerability management, including key metrics such as:

*   Number of open vulnerabilities by severity
*   Mean time to remediation
*   Number of vulnerabilities identified by source

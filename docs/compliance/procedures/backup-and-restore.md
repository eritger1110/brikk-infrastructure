# Backup and Restore Procedure

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the procedure for backing up and restoring Brikk's critical data and systems. The purpose of this procedure is to ensure that we can recover from a data loss event, such as a hardware failure, natural disaster, or cyberattack, with minimal disruption to our business and our customers.

## 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all critical data and systems, including but not limited to:

-   Production databases
-   Application servers
-   Customer data
-   Source code repositories

## 3. Backup Procedure

### 3.1. Backup Frequency

All critical data and systems will be backed up on a regular basis, according to the following schedule:

| System | Backup Frequency |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Production Databases** | Daily |
| **Application Servers** | Daily |
| **Customer Data** | Daily |
| **Source Code Repositories** | Real-time |

### 3.2. Backup Location

All backups will be stored in a secure, off-site location. Backups will also be replicated to a secondary, geographically separate location to provide additional redundancy.

### 3.3. Backup Encryption

All backups will be encrypted at rest and in transit to protect the confidentiality of the data.

## 4. Restore Procedure

### 4.1. Restore Testing

Restore procedures will be tested on a quarterly basis to ensure that we can successfully recover from a data loss event. The results of these tests will be documented and reviewed by the Security Team.

### 4.2. Restore Process

In the event of a data loss event, the following steps will be taken to restore the affected systems and data:

1.  The Incident Response Team (IRT) will be activated.
2.  The IRT will assess the extent of the data loss and determine the appropriate recovery strategy.
3.  The affected systems and data will be restored from the most recent backup.
4.  The restored systems and data will be tested to ensure that they are functioning correctly.

## 5. Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Operations Team** | - Performing regular backups.<br>- Testing restore procedures. |
| **Security Team** | - Overseeing the backup and restore process.<br>- Ensuring that all backups are secure. |

# Compliance Starter Pack

## Overview

This starter pack provides a lightweight, practical documentation set to accelerate HIPAA and SOC 2 readiness. It is designed to be a starting point for building a comprehensive compliance program and includes policies, procedures, evidence templates, and a controls matrix. All documents are in Markdown for easy version control and collaboration.

### How to Use This Pack

1.  **Review and Customize Policies**: The documents in the `policies` directory are high-level statements of intent. They should be reviewed, customized, and formally adopted by management.
2.  **Implement Procedures**: The `procedures` directory contains actionable checklists and workflows that implement the policies. These should be integrated into your daily operations.
3.  **Maintain Evidence**: The `evidence-templates` directory provides templates for logging critical compliance activities. These logs are essential for demonstrating compliance during an audit.
4.  **Map Controls**: The `controls-matrix.md` file maps the implemented controls to specific HIPAA and SOC 2 requirements. This is a living document that should be updated as new controls are added.

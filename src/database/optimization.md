# Database Optimization Strategies

This document outlines strategies for optimizing database performance in the Brikk platform.

## 1. Query Analysis

- **Identify Slow Queries**: Use tools like `pg_stat_statements` in PostgreSQL to identify queries that are consuming the most time and resources.
- **Analyze Execution Plans**: Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to understand how the database is executing queries and identify bottlenecks.

## 2. Indexing

- **Add Indexes to Foreign Keys**: Ensure all foreign key columns have indexes to speed up joins.
- **Index Frequently Queried Columns**: Add indexes to columns that are frequently used in `WHERE` clauses, `ORDER BY` clauses, and `JOIN` conditions.
- **Use Composite Indexes**: For queries that filter on multiple columns, create composite indexes.
- **Avoid Over-indexing**: Too many indexes can slow down write operations, so only add indexes that are necessary.

### Recommended Indexes:

- `agents(organization_id)`
- `api_keys(organization_id)`
- `webhooks(organization_id)`
- `workflows(organization_id)`
- `agent_services(agent_id)`
- `coordinations(initiator_agent_id)`
- `security_events(agent_id)`

## 3. Connection Pooling

- **Use a Connection Pooler**: Implement a connection pooler like PgBouncer or use the built-in connection pooling in SQLAlchemy to manage database connections efficiently.
- **Configure Pool Size**: Tune the size of the connection pool based on the application's workload and the database server's capacity.

## 4. Caching

- **Cache Frequent Reads**: Use a caching layer (like the `CachingService`) to cache the results of frequent and expensive read queries.
- **Invalidate Cache Correctly**: Implement a robust cache invalidation strategy to ensure data consistency.

## 5. Database Schema

- **Normalize the Schema**: Ensure the database schema is well-normalized to avoid data redundancy and improve data integrity.
- **Use Appropriate Data Types**: Use the most appropriate and efficient data types for each column.
